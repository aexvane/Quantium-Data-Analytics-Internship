Julia has asked us to evaluate the performance of a store trial which was performed in stores 77, 86 and 88.

This can be broken down by:

total sales revenue
total number of customers
average number of transactions per customer

Main areas of Focus are :

Select control stores – Explore data, define metrics, visualize graphs
Assessment of the trial – insights/trends by comparing trial stores with control stores
Collate findings – summarize and provide recommendations
